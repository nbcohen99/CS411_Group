## Project Layout
Our web app [Split Check](https://splitcheck.github.io/) uses the Mongo-Express-Angular-Node (MEAN) software stack.  The database and app *production* servers are both located at [54.164.165.203](http://54.164.165.203/) on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).  *Development* version can be found here:

```shell
├─ docs/          Documentation
├─ angular-dev/   AngularJS development files
│  └─ dist/         Local web directory to incrementally push to the production server
├─ mongo-dev/     Mongo development directory to eventually deploy on the database server
```
