# Architecture/Platform
Our team has decided to use Node.js and Angular as our Framework, AWS as our platform, HTML/CSS/javascript as our language, and are considering Postgresql or MongoDB as our database platform. We found that each of us has a specific part that we have experience or interest in, so we have divided ourselves into different leads each. Specifically, API and database handling (back end), front end handling, and an intermediate mediator to be able to connect the front and back end. At first we had planned to use MongoDB, however our lead for databases mentioned using Postgresql through coursework, so there have been some discussions for using that instead. Our API and intermediate leads both have had experience in their roles, so they decided to use platforms that they are both experienced with, and that are commonly used in practice. Our front end lead had limited experience with HTML/CSS, but is using this as a chance to learn as much as possible to create a customized website with simple but hopefully sufficient functionality. 
Because these roles are all very specific, it allows each lead to work independently and make progress. But because each role also connects to each other in layers/steps, it seems to enhance efficiency and productivity overall as well.
