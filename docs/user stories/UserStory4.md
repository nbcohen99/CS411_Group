# Primary User #4
## “Search” page - Choosing a Group
Once a user makes the filter selections as described in **Primary User #3**, he can select from a dropdown of groups he is a part of, and is given the option to omit any other members from the payment split if he chooses to do so. Finally, the user should input his Venmo ID and the total price that will be split among all group members, and an email will be sent to each of those group members with a link to Venmo
