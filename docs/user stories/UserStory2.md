## Creating a Group
A logged in user on the main page may click on a clearly marked “Groups” tab, upon which taking them to a separate page that handles all Group functionality. Much like creating a group DM on social media, or Discord for example, you are able to create a new group and invite users to it.
The group tab also shows invites and has a button to accept and join a new group.
To create a new group, there shall be some button dubbed “Create New Group”, opening a popup where you can invite Friends by their username, or name. Upon creating a new group, the logged in user shall be sent to the group’s individual page.
The logged in user that created the group shall be deemed the “Host/Owner” of the group. Only the Host/Owner will be given the option to add/kick members in the group; this will be done to control group size.
