# Primary User #2
## Navigating the Site
After logging in, a user will be redirected to their personal profile page. From there, the user can navigate to “friends”, “groups”, “search” pages, or log out using the log out button, all located on the navbar  at the top. 
The “friends” page allows a user to view a list of friends, and gives the option to “add” or “unfriend” each member listed. The “groups” page provides a list of all of the users groups and also allows the user to create new groups. If the user is a host, each member has an action to be removed from a group, but all general members are given the option to leave a group as well.
