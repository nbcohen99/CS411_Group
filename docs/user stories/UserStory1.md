## How to Create an Account and Log in
The user enters the website and clicks a button to log in with Google (Gmail). The button will load a pop-up window where the user can select and account that is already logged in, or if the account does not exist, the user can create a new one. Once the user correctly enters their account information, once it is authenticated, the site will reload to a user profile page.
