## “Search” page - Filters
The search page is where the functionality of the web app comes into play. The search page is where users input filters for restaurant preferences and are given options based on those inputs. After the user selects from filters such as price, distance, type of food, and location, a list of restaurants will appear in the drop down menu in the center of the page. If a user then selects a restaurant, the app will process this selection and provide Lyft ride information to that restaurant including type of ride, min/max price, and estimated time.
