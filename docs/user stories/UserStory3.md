# Primary User #3
## Personal Info (user profile)
Userâ€™s calculated budget from personal Venmo transactions is displayed in this page. The user will have the ability to edit this budget in the case that they want to spend less, or are willing to spend more than the average from traced transactions.
This page will also show the groups the user is hosting or is a member of. Clicking these groups will lead the user to access a separate page for each group.
There will also be a section for the recent places this user has been and will record how much they spent at each location (maybe have the option to give a personal rating for future reference/filter future recommendations)
