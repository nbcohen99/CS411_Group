## Secondary User #1: Emoji Recommendations
When a group member receives the payment request in Venmo, detailed by the  Primary User #5 story, the app will recommend emojis to use in the comments for the venmo transactions. This will be done through image processing of the receipt and choosing emojis related to the items on the receipt corresponding to the group member who is paying for it. If an even split is chosen for the bill, then emojis will be selected from all receipt items (i.e Choosing a pizza emoji if pizza is on the receipt)

## Secondary User #2: Making the payment
The host of the group will be in charge of managing the splits for the bill and will push Venmo requests to each member. Once these requests have been fulfilled by the secondary user, it will update their payment status on the web-app to ‘paid’.

## Secondary User #3: Logging out
At the top of the application, the name of the current logged in user will be displayed, along with a button to log out.  All groups in progress will still be saved if the user logs back in. This will bring the user back to the landing page described in Primary User #1
