**Reasons for Technology**

 

For our prototype, we chose to work
in Angular for the frontend. We chose this for several reasons.  One is that working in Angular allows us to
still work in HTML, CSS, or Javascript. This is helpful because some of us are only
familiar with these frameworks so it will still be easy to work in. For those
unfamiliar with Angular, this project would provide exposure to it which is a
good skill to have for the industry. Angular also creates a single-page
application which means that there will be no loading for the user on the site,
to make a better user experience. Angular is coded in typescript, which is allows
for optional typing and better code structure to make it easier to debug. This will
be helpful when multiple people are working on code and require others to look
it over.  Right now, out backend is using
PHP for a simple http request, and we have discussed using Mongo for our database.
